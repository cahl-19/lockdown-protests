keyStoreConfig:
    # Path to directory to store JWT signing keys. It is *very* important that these keys are kept private and
    # secure. Compromised keys will lead to a total breach of alll user accounts. Keys should be kept in a directory
    # readable only by the user account which runs the ldprotest server.

    # The directory must exist in the file system and be acessible by the user account which runs the ldprotest
    # server.

    # You probably do not want to store keys in tmpfs (the path below is for example purposes only) on a production
    # system because this will result in keys being deleted on each reboot.

    # If this option is set to the empty string or is left unspecified, keys will be volatile and will be lost each
    # time the applicatioon restarts.
